# webscrape

Web Scraping in Rust, made easy. Of course, Blazingly Fast. 

**webscrape** provides high level interfaces to run scraping pipelines with full JavaScript rendering support. Currently based on my custom [headless_chrome](https://github.com/masc-it/rust-headless-chrome) fork.

## Features

- Scrape DOM elements via CSS or XPath selectors.
- Automate interaction with the page (click, typing, etc).
- Proxy support.
- Build scraping pipelines in a declarative manner using YAML config files.
- Save data as you go in different formats. [SOON]
